Hi Team,

1. I have created the  Application using the MVC ,C#.NET and used the entity Framework to interact with the    database which is created by code first approach entity Model.

2. The repository pattern is implemented to address the seperation of concern

3. Autofac is used for the IOC container and injected the depenency through constructors.

4. Created the unit testing project to ensure the code quality for controllers and Business Service methods. However, limited  test cases due to time constraint.


However, due to the time constraint i have not got the chance to implement some other components such as:

1. Authorization and authentication. (Could be windows/Forms).
2. Much interested to do error handling by using custom exception filter with centralised logging either by using log4Net   or EnterpriseLibrary to which i had an exposure.
3. WOuld have implemented the user friendly messages on screen through bootstrap/ Css after CRUD operations. 


 Please Note :

 1. Application tested in Chrome and edge.There are some known issues with IE due to version compatibility.Hence did not get much chance to resolve them.
 1. Seeding data in to the database can be done by running the command called ' update-database' under the nugetPackageMangerConsole by selecting ApplicationRepository project.
    Or create product can be used to create a test data and verify the lisitng.
